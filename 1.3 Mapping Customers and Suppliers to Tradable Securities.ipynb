    "# Mapping Customers and Suppliers to Tradable Securities\n",
    "A key use-case of the Supply Chain Relationships DataFeed is Customer-to-Supplier Momentum, or the idea that customer returns drive supplier returns. In order to be able to incorporate such a strategy, is it vital to be able to map from a factset_entity_id to a tradable security such as a Ticker. This notebooks will walk through the process of mapping suppliers of a customer to their primary equity identifiers."

    "While a main use of the **ENT_SCR_RELEVANCE_RANK** table is to be able to identify the importance of a relationship to a given company, another great value of the table is to be able to plug a company into the **ranked_factset_entity_id** field and return all customer and supplier relationships no matter the source. We'll use this table to identify all suppliers of Walmart to then be able to retrieve their Tickers. In the query below, we allow for an input of a date as the Supply Chain DataFeed offers point-in-time data containing start and end dates for when a relationship was valid."
